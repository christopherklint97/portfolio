On October 26th, 2021, Next.js held an online conference for their release of Next.js 12.

It was a significant release including a brand new Rust compiler, Middleware (currently beta), and React Server Components (currently alpha).

I won't be getting too much into the details of the release since they already did such a great job explaining the important new features in [their blog post](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-12). Be sure to check it out if you want to read more about it.

What I instead would like to talk about is how important Next.js 12 is as a preview for the future of web development and what changes to look out for in the near future.

## Why should you listen to me?

To be honest, I do not have a straight answer to this question. Call it speculation if you will, but I am noticing some possible changes in the wind that could be worth mentioning now so that you are not caught being left behind.

And no one likes being left behind.

Without further ado, let's get crack-a-lackin'.

## Rust and web development

As mentioned previously, one of the new features of Next.js 12 is their new Rust compiler built on top of [SWC](https://swc.rs/). SWC is a Rust-based platform that tools such as [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and [Deno](https://deno.land/) use for both compilation and bundling.

That's all fine and dandy, but what exactly does that mean for you?

Well, to put it simply, Rust is growing. It has already crossed over into developer tools that us Javascripters and Typescripters use to make our everyday lives faster and smoother. You can even build web apps using a web framework called [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) or using [WebAssembly](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/).

I believe that we will begin seeing Rust being used for more tools and backed by more companies and sponsors in the near future which will change the way in how we build our web applications.

## React 18

As of November 15, 2021, [React 18 is now in beta](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/112). This is huge!

The Next.js team has been working closely with the...
